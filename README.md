# Service Workers | Architecture and Usage

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the article **"[Service Workers | Architecture and Usage](https://medium.com/@iheathers/service-workers-architecture-and-usage-5b1e98731cc3)"** by Pritam Suwal Shrestha. This repository contains code examples and resources discussed in the article, which explores the basics of Service Workers, their lifecycle, and practical implementations to enhance web applications.

## üöÄ Overview

Service Workers act as intermediaries between the web browser and the network, enabling developers to create reliable, seamless offline experiences for users. They provide the ability to cache resources, intercept network requests, and run scripts in the background, all without blocking the main thread of the application.

This repository includes:

- **Basic setup**: A simple service worker registration example.
- **Lifecycle events**: Demonstrations of install, activate, and fetch events.
- **Caching strategies**: How to cache resources for offline use and update cached assets.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To get started with the examples in this repository:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iheathers/Service-Worker.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Service-Worker
   ```
3. **Open the project in your preferred code editor**.

4. **Serve the project**:
   - You can use any local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server, Python's SimpleHTTPServer, etc.) to serve the files locally and test the service worker in action.
   - Example using Python:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server
     ```

5. **Open the project in your web browser**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the appropriate port) to see the service worker in action.
